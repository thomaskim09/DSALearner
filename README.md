# Data Structures & Algorithms Learning Platform

This project is an interactive web-based platform designed to help users learn and visualize fundamental data structures and algorithms. The primary goal is to provide a hands-on learning experience that goes beyond static text and diagrams.

## Core Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Key data structures, like Binary Search Trees, are rendered visually. Users can see how the structure changes as they perform operations like insertion and deletion.
- **Side-by-Side Code Display:** For every action performed in the visualizer, the corresponding source code is displayed. This helps bridge the gap between the abstract concept and its concrete implementation.
- **Complexity Analysis:** Each operation's code is accompanied by its Big O time complexity, a critical concept for understanding algorithm efficiency.
- **Step-by-Step Animations:** Complex processes, such as tree traversals, are broken down into step-by-step animations. Users can play, pause, and step through the animation to understand the flow of the algorithm in detail.

This platform aims to make learning data structures and algorithms more engaging and intuitive by providing immediate feedback and clear visualizations.
