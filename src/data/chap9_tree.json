      "term": "Tree Traversal",
      "definition": "To traverse a tree means to visit all the nodes in some specified order. There are three simple ways: inorder, preorder, and postorder."

      "term": "Inorder Traversal",
      "definition": "Visits the left child, then the node itself, then the right child. An inorder traversal of a binary search tree will cause all the nodes to be visited in ascending order."

      "term": "Preorder Traversal",
      "definition": "Visits the node itself, then the node's left subtree, and finally the node's right subtree."

      "term": "Postorder Traversal",
      "definition": "Traverses the node's left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally visits the node itself."
